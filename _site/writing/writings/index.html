<h1>My Writings</h1>
<p>I have written work scattered all over the internet. I have pieces I'm proud of during my time as an editor of the Daily, and I regularly post to ua.ssmu.ca about my job. Because the ua.ssmu.ca site is particularly precarious, I will create a copy of my best posts here, with minor revisions.</p>
