## About Me

I'm a fifth year student at McGill University with a double major in English (Cultural Studies) and Statistics. I'm also the Vice President University Affairs at SSMU, the undergraduate student association at McGill. 

My interests are in fields called things like "communication" or "digital humanities" or "information science" or "science and technology" or "cultural studies" and other fake words.  

I'm also big into trans struggle & resistance, for slightly selfish reasons.
